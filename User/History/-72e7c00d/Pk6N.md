    1. The first word in the Content is the Type of copy needed
    - "title" should be limited to 60 characters maximum and 45 characters minimum and are headings for other content and should be phrased as a Title
    - "desc" should be limited to 1000 characters maximum and 900 characters minimum and are the body of a section and should be phrased as a Description
    - "proposal" should be limited to 1500 characters maximum and 1400 characters minimum and are the body of a proposal and should be phrased as a Proposal

    2. Be sure to include all talking points within the selected text that follows the Type
    3. Proposals should always include the talking point related to me being new to the Freelancer platform, but having 7 successful years on Upwork so my bid is negotiable because a good review will pay off more in the long run than the actual project budget and that they can learn more information about me from the links on my profile.

Repeat for a total of 3 different versions for me to choose between. If I desire for changes I will provide the Copy Draft # and the desired changes.

## Tone Examples

### Title

    - API and CRM integrations into streamlined automatons
    - Turbocharged Rudy's eCom engine, boosting sales & efficiency
    - Engineered TerraVerse, the eBay of big rigs and bulldozers

### Description

    - At Biz Esteem, I spearheaded API and CRM integrations & automatons, transforming a dumpster fire of manual processes into a well-oiled machine of efficiency. I crafted bespoke solutions for a diverse client base, conjuring tech-savvy magic to streamline workflows, and increase productivity by 30%. My artful blend of corporate wizardry and hipster hackery yielded a 25% reduction in operational costs, making our clients wonder what kind of crazy juice we'd been drinking. By turning chaos into a beautiful, profitable nonsense, I elevated Biz Esteem's reputation as a master of digital alchemy.

    - Rudy's e-commerce machine was sputtering, choked by a clunky BigCommerce setup bleeding resources like a ruptured oil tanker. Their product onboarding crawled like a snail on sedatives, and their SEO game was weaker than gas station coffee. We ditched BigCommerce for a lean Shopify machine and engineered a product system so slick, it slashed SKU onboarding time by 90%. This turbo boost tripled their product count to over 500k SKUs. We transformed their SEO, turning product descriptions into Google-pleasing gold. We automated order submissions and tracking retrieval, turning a manual mess into a smooth profit pipeline. Plus, we built a Year-Make-Model converter that would make a Swiss Army knife jealous. The results? Sales exploded 2.5x in 3 months, with 15% month-on-month growth still climbing. The kicker – they're running this turbo-charged operation with 27% less time investment. Now that's efficiency on steroids!

    - TerraPoint, just another player in the heavy machinery market until we unleashed TerraVerse - a data-devouring beast turning the industry on its head. This digital Frankenstein scrapes 30+ major websites faster than a cheetah on Red Bull, consolidating listings for everything from monster trucks to mega-dozers. We didn't just build a website; we created a virtual colosseum where buyers and sellers duke it out in real-time. Bidding on TerraPoint? You're simultaneously throwing down on TruckPaper and dozens more. Selling? Post once and your listing spreads like wildfire across the web. The kicker? We did this without asking permission. Like throwing a block party and inviting the whole neighborhood - whether they liked it or not. The result? A one-stop-shop set to dominate faster than you can say "caterpillar." Watch out, eBay. While you're cornering the market on grandma's Buick, TerraPoint's revving up to own the online heavy machinery world. It's not disruption - it's a digital revolution.

### Proposal

    - Here's the deal: I'm an Analytics & Business Consulting ninja with over 15 years of experience. While I'm new to Freelancer, I've been killing it on Upwork for nearly 7 years. I'm more excited about nailing that review than cashing in huge checks, so rest assured, your budget is safe, and your satisfaction is my ultimate payoff. Take a peek at my profile for more details, including links to my LinkedIn and websites. Now, let's get down to brass tacks. When I take on a new client, I don't just deliver what's asked for—hell, that's just the starting line. I dive deep into the entire digital landscape, conducting a comprehensive analysis that goes beyond surface-level requests. This involves creating Decision Matrixes that not only map out your current position but also guide you on where to focus your efforts for maximum impact. Impact vs. Reward Matrixes are part of the package too. These tools are designed to help you make informed choices amidst the chaos, ensuring you're not just navigating blindly through a clusterfuck of data but strategically driving real results. My approach is about transforming a potential shitshow into a well-oiled machine of insights and strategies. You'll get a clear picture of where you stand today and where your efforts will yield the best results tomorrow. Ready to turn this data maze into a streamlined strategy? Let's make it happen and show the world that we've got this digital hellscape under control!

    - Here's the deal - I'm a ClickUp ninja with 4 years of daily use under my belt, and I'm more stoked about getting that sweet review (new to Freelancer but Upwork successful for nearly 7 years) than raking in the cash (I'll take less than $15/hr, but the system won't let me bid low). While home renovation isn't my jam, I'm a CRM wizard, and I know how to turn ClickUp into a well-oiled machine. With some clever automatons and templates, I can whip up a low-maintenance solution that'll make your life easier. Before we get this party started, take a peek at my profile and websites to see what I'm brining to the table and understand I use ClickUp as my own personal CRM, and automatons are my compulsion.

    - I'm not here to toot my own horn, but I've been the mastermind behind some of the most iconic YMM filtering systems in the industry. With 7 years of smashing it on Upwork (yeah, I am new to Freelancer, reviews are the real gold here, and the Benjamin's can take a backseat for now., i.e. negotiable) and a portfolio (check profile [still in development], websites & LinkedIn) that speaks for itself, I'm more than just a freelancer - I'm a sorcerer who can turn any YMM hellscape into a streamlined, profitable machine. My claim to fame? Helping develop a new YMM filtering system with SearchAuto, and crafting one of the first YMM filtering systems for Shopify back in 2013 for JeepWorld.com (yeah, I'm that OG). And let's not forget my extensive knowledge of integrating YMM filtering systems with APIs and industry-leading solutions like Convermax - I've got this shit on lock. With over 30 clients in the YMM industries under my belt, I'm the real deal. No one brings more experience to the table than me. So, if you're ready to turn your YMM clusterfuck into a beautiful, profitable masterpiece, let's get this started!
