## Original Text

    ```txt
    Yo, I was gifted a year of Perplexity Pro by a development team I assisted on a project earlier in the year. I am a HUGE user of Perplexity, have been using it since it launched and highly recommend it's usage over Google for most searches.

    Perplexity has given all Pro users the ability to gift a MONTH FREE of Pro to anyone they want. So, I am passing you the link. If the link doesn't work, just use the discount code in the link during a "Pro sign-up", which does not require a payment method.

    If you have never used Perplexity, I highly advise it.
